## Your Friendly Neighborhood Weather App

This application I developed a dynamic weather web application that provides real-time weather information to users. By utilizing a weather API, the application delivers accurate and up-to-date weather data for locations worldwide.  Users can search for weather information in any city or region globally. The application provides a 5 day weather forecasts of a specific region's higest temp, wind, and humidity, allowing users to plan their activities and make informed decisions based on weather predictions.
